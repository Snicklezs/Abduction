# Abduction
My first game 
The games concept is simple - You are an' alien (well, an' alien to humans) that has been abducted by the human race. Your goal is to escape the enemy spaceship using your intuition and logic.

This is my first project so I am taking all constructive critisism very seriously ; please feel free to point out what will probably be many flaws.
